# Aletopelta

**[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)**

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code.  
I am using my own framework [Belodon](https://github.com/domix24/belodon) to handle the puzzle

## Key Dates
_maybe could be interesting in the future_
- *Started* learning Elixir - December 4, 2024
- *Known* about Advent of Code - During the month of November 2024 from Twitch
- *Known* about Elixir - Probably between December 1st and December 4th, saw some Elixir code and got interested by the |> operator

## Note
This was my _very first_ time with Elixir, I kept all of my old code into another branch [old-main](https://github.com/Domix24/aletopelta/tree/old-main) so you can the progress through the days.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `aletopelta` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:aletopelta, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/aletopelta>.
